The Automated Hydroponic Growtower is a hydroponic system that uses a Raspberry Pi to automate many services such as watering the plants, turning on the UV grow lights and telling you when you need to fill the water reervoir. The purpose of a grow tower is being able to grow plants faster and without soil. The water is going staright to the roots thus expediting the growth procces, at least thatrs my basic understanding of the project.

The diagrams above are both a basic sketch up of the grow tower and a wiring diagram of the first iteration.

The first iteration is quite big and what we are currently atempting to reach is about 5 feet tall. Thats a lot easier to move around and transport than an almost 7 foot one.

Both Cailin Yeager and I, (Petie Deveer) were quite envolved with the fabrication of the original batch of grow towers back in 2019 and are working to improve and simplify the construction process.

This Repository is going to be full of process reports, code(Node-Red JS), photos/documentation and everything else we feel should be added to better document the entire process.
